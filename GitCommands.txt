// to stop viewing git log output, press "q" (which stands for quit)

git log --graph --oneline branch_name branch_name
// shows the branches' commits (that you choose to compare)
// graph for visual form
// oneline for simplifying the output

git log -n1

git status
// shows the branch you're on

git merge branch_name2
git merge branch_name branch_name2

git pull remote_name branch_name
// remote (e.g., "origin") where you'd like to push to
// local branch/repo that you'd like to push to it

git fetch remote_name branch_name

// without having to worry about merges/conflicts
// places the updates in a separate branch

git fetch remote_name
